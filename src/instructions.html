            <p class="lead">It can be difficult to know what one serving of bitters is. The term dash and dropper have been used for centuries, but
            how much liquid is that?! After some extensive R&D, we have come to the conclusion that a serving of bitters is just nder 1mL of liquid. In general, both a dash (from Bittercube 1.7 oz or 5 oz bottles) or dropper (from Bittercube 1 oz bottles) are equivalent to that. However, there are some caveats. Follow the instructions below for an accurate measurement.</p>

          <p class="lead">While holding the bottle in one hand, unscrew the eye dropper cap and squeeze the bulb of the dropper twice, filling it to about three-quarters of its capacity. The bitters should not enter the bulb. Release the bitters by squeezing the bulb repeatedly until the dropper is empty.</p>

            Remove the cap from the bottle. Holding the neck of the bottle and using one fluid movement, swing the bottle until upside down. With a downward thrust, expel a dash of bitters from the bottle.

          <div class="editable">
            <p>When using a full bottle, the liquid level will be in the neck and you will need eight to ten dashes to expel the appropriate amount of bitters. This seems like a lot, but only a very little comes out each dash. Once the liquid level falls to the shoulders of the bottle, six dashes is sufficient to achieve one serving. By the time the liquid level has reached approximately an inch from the bottom of the bottle (or lower), three dashes will be necessary.</p>
            <p>When dispensing two or more dashes of bitters into a cocktail at once, don’t swing the bottle back around, just thrust back up and then down to dispense another dash.</p>

            <p>*As long as the liquid level in the bottle lies between the top of the label and within an inch of the bottom of the bottle, a dash will produce a nearly identical amount of bitters as the dropper from a one-ounce bottle.</p> 
            <p>When using a full bottle, the liquid level will be in the neck. You will need three or four dashes to expel the appropriate amount of bitters.
