  Dry, Sweet, French, Italian, German -- the world would be a lot less
  interesting without vermouth. You wouldnâ€™t be able to make a Martini, a
  Manhattan or countless other cocktails. But what is vermouth, and why are
  there so many variations? During this class, we will taste four different
  vermouths, explain how to use them in cocktails and other suggestions and tips
  to make great drinks at home!
