  In the mood to create a bespoke tonic? Join our Tailor Made Tonic Lab and
  youâ€™ll do just that! Taste through 16 botanical essences, learning a bit about
  their history and makeup, and then work as a group to create a bespoke tonic
  formula. Once the formula is completed and approved, enjoy your creation as a
  cocktail! Class includes a bottle of tonic for you to take home.
