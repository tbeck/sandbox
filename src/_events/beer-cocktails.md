  In this 60 minute workshop we will explore the world of cocktails using beer
  as a main ingredient. This weekend is also the launch of a beer Vennture
  Brewing created based on our cocktail called The Kid. We will discuss that
  process as well as offer other suggestions and demonstrate various cocktail
  concepts with different style beers.


  The workshop includes 2 beer cocktail tastings.
