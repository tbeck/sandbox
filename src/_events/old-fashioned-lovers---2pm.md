  Cooped up at home? We have the perfect cure, an online cocktail class! The
  webcast will allow attendees to participate and ask questions throughout the
  experience.


  We take the classic Old Fashioned and show you how to make two unique and
  delicious variations. We'll demonstrate how to properly stir a cocktail,
  discuss countless riffs on the classic and provide ideas for creating your own
  version!


  With cocktail kit and bottled cocktail add-ons, make a day of it!


  Cocktails include:

  - Cognac Old Fashioned

  - Heirloom Pineapple Old Fashioned
