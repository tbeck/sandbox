  Prince's sudden passing on April 21, 2016 inspired us to create a few
  cocktails while we were operating Dock18 Cocktail Lab and the Sometimes it
  Snows in April menu was born.


  In April 2017, we revisited the drinks we had created and added a few more for
  a full menu.

  For one weekend in April 2018, we created a few more drinks and did a pop up
  event with our friends at Company Brewing in Milwaukee.


  This year, the tradition continues with a full cocktail menu that includes
  drinks from previous iterations of Sometimes it Snows in April. New for this
  edition, we  collaborated with local brewery/coffee roaster Vennture Brew Co.
  who created a beer that mimics our cocktail The Kid. The beer will be
  available on tap and we will also have the option to use it as a base for the
  drink (The Cocktail Formerly Known as The Kid). The menu is complete with
  Bursters and other surprises.

  Don't forget to take a selfie in The Prince Room!
