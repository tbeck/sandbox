  In this class, we will discuss the importance of Vermouth in two classic
  cocktails - Manhattan and Martini. We will demonstrate how to properly
  measure, stir and pour these great cocktails so you can look like a pro when
  making them at home. We'll also provide recipe cards so you don't forget the
  golden ratio for both libations.

  3 cocktails included in the class.


  All guests will receive a 10% discount on bar tools in the Bazaar immediately
  following the class.
