  Flowers aren't just for looking at, they've played an essential role in some
  of our favorite bitters, liqueurs and cocktails! Heirloom Liqueurs is proud to
  contribute to that history with our Creme de Flora, crafted with a bouquet of
  vibrant flowers native to five continents including marigold and chamomile.


  Learn how to use Creme de Flora in summer time classics like the Margarita and
  Vesper as well as how to unlock it's floral magic to create exciting, new
  cocktails that are dripping with patio vibes and perfect to bring to a picnic.
  We'll also include a cheese and meat board from Village Cheese Shop for you to
  nibble on during the class!

  Class includes 3 cocktails plus a Creme de Flora tasting along with a recipe
  card to make the drinks at home.


  All participants will receive a 10% discount on all Heirloom Liqueurs
  purchased in the Bazaar immediately following the class.
