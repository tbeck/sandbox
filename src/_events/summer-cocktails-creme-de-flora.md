  Heirloom Creme de Flora was originally known as House Creme de Flora because
  we produced versions of it for restaurants and bars around the USA starting
  back in 2009. Heirloom Creme de Flora was created with a bouquet of vibrant
  flowers native to five continents including marigold and chamomile, resulting
  in a versatile liqueur that can serve as an aperitif or to provide nuance to a
  cocktail.
   Class includes 3 cocktails plus a Creme de Flora tasting along with a recipe card to make the drinks at home. All class participants will also receive a 10% discount on all Heirloom Liqueurs purchased in the Bazaar immediately following the class.
