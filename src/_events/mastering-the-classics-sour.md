  We continue our seven-part cocktail series, Mastering the Classics, with the
  Sour. Better known as a Daiquiri, Gimlet or Whiskey Sour, this class will help
  familiarize yourself with the tools and learn the technique to properly shake
  a cocktail, plus learn the golden ratio for a classic Sour and receive
  information to make great cocktails at home. Plus, receive 10% off all home
  bar tools in the Bazaar after the class!
