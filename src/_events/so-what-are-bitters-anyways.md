  This interactive facility tour starts with a welcome drink in the Bazaar. We
  will go behind the scenes in the production facility, where we will navigate
  the entire bitters-making process from raw botanicals to bottling all while
  tasting and smelling bitters along the way. The tour finishes with a cocktail
  at the Bar where you will find your inner mixologist and choose your own
  bitters to use in your cocktail.

  Tour admission includes a souvenir rocks glass!
