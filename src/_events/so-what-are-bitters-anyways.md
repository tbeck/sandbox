description: "This interactive facility tour starts with a welcome drink in the Bazaar. We will go behind the scenes in the production facility, where we will navigate the entire bitters-making process from raw botanicals to bottling. We'll also make a stop at the R&D lab for a taste of something we are currently working on. The tour finishes with a cocktail of your choice from the Bazaar and a\_bitters demonstration, during which you'll lick and smell your own hands in front of strangers. Trust us, it's cool and not weird at all.\nAll tour guests get 10% off Bittercube products in the Bazaar."
