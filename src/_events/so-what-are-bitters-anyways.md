description: "Ever wonder how bitters are made and how to effectively use them? This interactive facility tour starts with a welcome drink in the Bazaar. We will go behind the scenes in the production facility, where we will navigate the entire bitters-making process from raw botanicals to bottling. Next, we will make a stop at the R&D lab and taste something that we are currently working on. The tour finishes in The Conference Room with a cocktail of your choice from the Bazaar and a\_bitters demonstration. You'll lick and smell your own hands in front of strangers. It's cool and not weird at all.\nWe'll give you 10% off all Bittercube Bitters in the Bazaar whether you enjoy yourself or not."
