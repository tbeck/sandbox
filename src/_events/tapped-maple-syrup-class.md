  Making maple syrup is a Wisconsin spring ritual that deserves celebrating. 
  The Solin family has been making maple syrup in small batches for five
  generations and currently produce and sell craft infused, barrel-aged and pure
  maple syrup from sustainably managed forests in northern Wisconsin. Join us
  for a special 90 minute cocktail class featuring Tapped Maple Syrup. We'll
  make spring cocktails using maple syrup and special guest Jeremy Solin from
  Tapped will educate us on the history of his family's sugarbush and provide
  samples of their various syrups.

  Class includes 3 cocktails and a special take home treat!
