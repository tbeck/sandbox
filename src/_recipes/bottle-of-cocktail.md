  Recipe adapted from Tom Bullock's 1917 "The Ideal Bartender", the first
  cocktail book published by an African American author. Bullock is part of a
  rich legacy of Black pre-prohibition bartenders.


  This recipe is a batched improved Old Fashioned, and aptly named a bottle of
  cocktail, as historically the Old Fashioned was the original cocktail.
