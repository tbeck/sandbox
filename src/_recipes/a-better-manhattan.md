  <p>Add all of the ingredients to a stirring vessel and then fill with ice.
  Stir with a bar spoon until chilled and strain into cocktail glass.</p><p>Ben
  Potts, a native Miamian 10 years of working as a bartender in a variety of
  establishments from dive bars to cocktail bars and fancyish restaurants. He
  recalls his first exposure, about 6 or 7 years, to the Bittercube brand, when
  he first tried Cherry Bark Vanilla bitters. &ldquo;I was blown away. Such a
  unique product and so many applications, I started using it in everything.
  Over time I tried the rest of the line and continue to use the latest and
  greatest creations from the company. I now have a bar and two restaurants and
  use Bittercube, religiously, as often as I can.&rdquo;</p>
