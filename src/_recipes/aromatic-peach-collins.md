name: Aromatic Peach Collins
bartender:
description: >-
  This collins variation implements beer as an effervescent punch, providing a
  malty character to balance the sweetness and acidity from the peach. The honey
  syrup and bourbon find harmony with the aromatic Heirloom Alchermes, while the
  Orange Bitters and lemon juice bind all of the bold flavors.
