  <p>In a bowl, mix the dry ingredients. In kitchen-aid, combine butter and
  sugars using the flat beater on a low setting. Add egg and bitters and turn up
  a bit until fluffy. Add dry ingredients and mix on low until basically
  combined. Remove the kitchen-aid bowl and fold in chocolate chips. Using a big
  spoon, place 12 chunks of dough onto a parchment lined baking
  sheet.</p><p>Bake in a preheated oven at 350 for 12 minutes. They won&rsquo;t
  look done, but after a few minutes to set, they&rsquo;ll be perfectly chewy
  and stay that way! When you remove the cookies from the oven, leave them on
  the pan for a couple minutes, then transfer to a wire rack.</p>
