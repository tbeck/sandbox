bio: >-
  Samantha “Sam” Goebel has been in the service industry for 13 years now. It
  has had its ups and downs, but she has an appreciation for the experiences
  because it has given her time to identify her strengths, solidify her passions
  and further shape her values. If she had to choose one word to describe
  herself it would be relentless and in the best way possible. She’s relentless
  when making, testing and perfecting cocktails. New to craft bartending, Sam
  credits Bittercube for teaching her everything from the basics to how to
  construct and teach others craft cocktails. “The knowledge Bittercube gave me
  will forever shape the style of cocktails I create.”
