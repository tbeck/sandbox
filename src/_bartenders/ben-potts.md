  Ben Potts, a native Miamian 10 years of working as a bartender in a variety of
  establishments from dive bars to cocktail bars and fancyish restaurants. He
  recalls his first exposure, about 6 or 7 years, to the Bittercube brand, when
  he first tried Cherry Bark Vanilla bitters. "I was blown away. Such a unique
  product and so many applications, I started using it in everything. Over time
  I tried the rest of the line and continue to use the latest and greatest
  creations from the company. I now have a bar and two restaurants and use
  Bittercube, religiously, as often as I can."
