He recalls his first exposure, about 6 or 7 years, to the Bittercube brand, when he first tried Cherry Bark Vanilla bitters. &ldquo;I was blown away. Such a unique product and so many applications, I started using it in everything. Over time I tried the rest of the line and continue to use the latest and greatest creations from the company. I now have a bar and two restaurants and use Bittercube, religiously, as often as I can.&rdquo;",
